# Linux-Assignment-1

Exercise 1: Birthday

Create a simple Linux Shell Program that takes in two arguments from the user (birth month and birth date) and prints out the results, along with the number of arguments.



Exercise 2: Voting Age

Create a Linux Shell Program that asks the user their age and then runs a conditional check to determine if the user is old enough to vote. Store this code in voting_check.sh, and save the results in voting_check_results.txt.
